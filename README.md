# YBFS
ShinyApp code to explore various measures of preschool enrolment and the target population of children, AKA year before first year of School (YBFS).

This app is designed to assist evaluation of the performance indicators of access to early childhood education. The side-by-side comparison of the three existing measures of preschool enrolment along with three population denominators provides important context for decisions on future measurement and reporting requirements.
